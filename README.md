# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
##### Kickstarter is where creators share new new projects, ideas and products to raise funding for them. Creators set a funding goal, launch date and a deadline. They also create reward levels for backers who pledge specific amounts. The more a backer pledges, the bigger the reward for the indiviual who donated. When backers have contributed enough to  a creator's project, the creator can successfully produce their vision.

### Purpose
##### Our client's theatre play "Fever" came close to its Kickstarter fundraising goal in a short amount of time.  The client wanted to know how other theatre Kickstarter campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

##### To answer this question we need to determine the Kickstarter outcomes based on launch date and the Kickstarter outcomes based on goals for theatre plays. The "Outcomes" tells us if the Kickstarter campaign met its goal.  "Goals" tells us how much money each campaign will need to succeed.

## Analysis and Challenges
##### Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.
##### Filter the Data omit data we aren't interested in
##### Format the Spreadsheet to show percentages

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
##### 	From the Outcomes Based on Goals chart we can see that Theatre Kickstarter campaigns were mostly successful if launched in May and June.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
##### Theatre Kickstarter campaigns with goals less than $5000 are more successful. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
##### What are some limitations of this dataset?
##### We are unable to if the length of the campaign has any relation to its campaign success or failure. 
	
##### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
